<p>Welcome to the Gabii Museum! Inside the museum you will find several 3D models of graves found at the Area B Gabii excavation site in Italy. The museum has three different grave types on display; however, one grave type is the main focus. This grave type is called a cappuccina grave - not to be confused with the popular coffee drink! A cappucinna grave is composed of ceramic tiles or slabs arranged in a tent-like structure on top of the body being buried. This means that in order to excavate the skeleton, archaeologists first had to remove the ceramic slabs! </p>

<p>While the cappuccina grave is the main focus of the Gabii Museum right now, the other two grave types on display serve as comparisons between the different types of graves that have been found at Gabii. </p>

<p>The second type of grave on display at the Gabii Museum is an infant burial.</p>

<p>The third type of grave on display at the Gabii Museum is a clay sarchophagus. </p>

<p>Please take a tour through the Gabii Museum! You can interact with all of the 3D models and learn more information about the excavations by clicking each of the graves. No flash photography, please!</p>
